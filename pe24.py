"""
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
